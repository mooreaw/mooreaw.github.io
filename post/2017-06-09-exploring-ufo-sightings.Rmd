While flipping through an issue of *the Economist* a few years ago, I stumbled across an [article](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21605918-everything-you-need-know-about-ufos-0) summarizing UFO sightings reported across the US. It wasn't a full feature, but the topic was playful and I lingered on it longer than I spent with the rest of the issue. The author had put together a map charting sightings by state, and a plot looking at how sightings were distributed across the day. Their conclusions were pretty straightforward:

1. sightings are more likely to be rural, "shunning" big cities due to light pollution
2. sightings are most most likely to occur
  - when people aren't working 
  - when people are likely to be drinking

For a short blurb, these takeaways seem tidy, but for a piece titled "Everything you need to know about UFOs", I felt like there wasn't enough to chew on. How much is alcohol really implicated in sightings of this kind? What about other local factors? These felt like glaring questions, but my musing was shelved when I closed the magazine. Lucky for me, Kaggle posted an updated version of the dataset to [download](https://www.kaggle.com/NUFORC/ufo-sightings), and I couldn't wait to look at some of these questions closer.

Each row in the data is an individually reported sighting, archived by the National UFO Research Center in Washingon [(NUFORC)](http://www.nuforc.org/). Over 80,000 events are recorded, going all the way back to the early 1900s. In addition to listing the date/time that a sighting was reported, the shape of the object, city, state, country, and latitude/longitude coordinates are all recorded. Most of the reports are from the US (`r percent(nrow(us) / nrow(scrubbed))`), so I decided to keep my focus there.

### The number of sightings reported is increasing

As far as I know, national excitement about UFOs was strongest during the Cold war. [Project Blue Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Book) was set up by the US Airforce in the 50s, and aimed to collect evidence and explain different sightings being reported. It was ultimately shut down due to discontinued funding and inconclusive findings. I expected to see more documented sightings between the 50s-70s, but this definitely isn't reflected in the file. This is a good point to consider the limitations of what we're working with. NUFORC was started in 1974, so perhaps it's surprising they've taken the time to record anything earlier than that at all. Secondly, the number of sightings reported to NUFORC, and the "actual" number of sightings in a given place aren't the same thing. 

That said, the number of sightings in each state has seen a steady climb since 2000. My guess is that due to prominence of search engines, awareness of NUFORC (and thus, the likelihood of reporting) has increased. You can follow the trend with the boxplots below. Each state contributes their count for a given year, and the boxplot helps give a sense how much they vary from each other.

```{r medians-over-time}
by_year_boxplot <- us %>% 
  count(year_sighted, state) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  filter(year_sighted > 1990) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(year_sighted), y = n)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill = "steelblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)
  ) +
  labs(x = "", y = "# of Sightings", title = "Median Number of State Sightings, 1991-2013<br>(Hover for detail)")

ggplotly(by_year_boxplot)
```
*(The outliers from each year reliably include a handful of states from the west, like Washington and California. More on that later.)*

### What people report seeing

One of the things I was most curious about that went unmentioned in the *Economist* piece was what people say they're seeing! The next chart looks at the composition of all US sightings reported during each year. The thicker the color band, the higher the percentage of a year's sightings can be attributed to a set of shapes. Across the whole time span, the most common kind of UFO are lights (maybe looking something like [this](https://youtu.be/qxLEnqsUYS4)), but this wasn't always the case. Earlier sightings were much more likely to report the classic saucer/disk shape. The fact that we don't have as many reports from the 60s and 70s is really disappointing here. Because we're simply seeing thousands more sightings in recent times, it's hard to say why the disk shape has fallen out of favor. Air travel has also become increasingly ubiquitious since the 70s, so it's hard to say how much of the share of "lights" sightings can be attributed to that.

```{r shapes, fig.height=8.5, fig.width=9.5, fig.align="center"}
shape_lut <- c(
  "cylinder"  = "cylinders, cigars, crescents, cigars, crosses",

### Seasonal differences

Next, I wanted to know whether there's a particular "season" for spotting UFOs. To get there, I created a rate of sightings per million people in the US population. This is a point where we can get a grip on just how rare sightings are, per-person-- in 2013 we're only seeing 2.4~ sightings per million people. You can see things get busier as we move toward the present, but there are also defined portions of the year that people are most likely to report sightings-- namely during the summer and fall. This lines up with what the *Economist* reported (i.e. sightings happen most frequently during evenings and weekends), given that these parts of the year tend to be when people spend the most time outside.

```{r usa-yr-month, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=10, fig.align="center"}
# dataset from tidyr
data(population)

uspop <- filter(population, country == "United States of America")

p2 <- us %>% 
  count(mo = month(date_time), year_sighted) %>% 
  inner_join(uspop, by = c("year_sighted" = "year")) %>% 
  mutate(
    Rate = n %>% divide_by(population) %>% multiply_by(1000000),
    Month = factor(mo, levels = 1:12, labels = str_sub(month.name, 1, 3)),
    Year  = factor(year_sighted)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x    = Year,
    y    = Month,
    fill = Rate
  )) +
  geom_tile() +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "white", high = "blue") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = "", y = "", title = "UFO Sightings in the USA per 1,000,000 People")

ggplotly(p2)
```

### Where are sightings most likely to happen?

As I mentioned above, the *Economist* piece suggests that sightings tend to spurn big cities, rationale being that light pollution drives down reports. They also suggested that sightings favor the US/Canada border, and other rural areas. I'm not sure if I've reached the same conclusions... The map below reflects two pieces of data for each county in the US during 2013: population density (people/km^2), and sightings reported. The little grid below reflects how I've categorized each county. The top-left (dark-grey) represents counties with a really high population density but low numbers of sightings. The bottom right (deep brown) represents counties with a low population density but really high sighting count. Up in the top right we have counties whose number of sightings tracks well with their population size.

The thing I find striking is that there are a few really urban counties that still show a large number of sightings. Cook (Chicago, IL), Wayne (Detroit, MI), King (Seattle, WA), New York, and San Francisco all follow this pattern. We do see a fair amount of rural counties with disproportionate levels of sightings in the west and northeast, but I'm not sold on the "shunning" asserted in the *Economist* piece. Additionally, the central US (including the borders) appears fairly neglected as far as sightings go. This makes me feel the urban/ruralilty relationship isn't super straightforward.

### Are there cultural or population-based factors that are related to sightings?

What about other local characteristics? The author in the *Economist* piece seemed to enjoy the wry assertion that drunk (and probably rural) people are the ones stumbling around and reporting these things. I'm not inclined think alcohol consumption wouldn't be related to a person experiencing a "sighting", but I wanted to look closer at that assertion. At the same time, states and regions are obviously not reducible to their drinking habits, and I wanted to bring some other features to bear. In order to examine these relationships, I built a regression model with state-based counts of sightings from 2013. Given that we're modeling counts of sightings, I opted to use a Poisson regression instead of a regular OLS model. With our dependent variable set, I looked at the following list of predictors:

1. *US Census Estimates:* 
    - population size, median income, and median cost of rent (converted to Z-scores)
    - percent of total population recorded as white, black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latino
    - percent of total population with a bachelor's degree or higher
    - median age
2. *Religiosity:*
    - gathered from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_religiosity), reported by Gallup polling
    - percentage of sampled individuals who rate religion as 'important' or 'very important'
3. *CDC prevalence of binge-drinking:*
    - data available [online](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/data-stats.htm)
    - state prevalence (%) of binge/excessive drinking estimated using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey
4. *State Big-5 Personality Traits from Rentfrow et al. (2013):*
    - publication available [online](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-a0034434.pdf) from the American Psychological Association
    - T-Scores for each state on the [Big-5 personality traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits), *openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism* based on aggregated online samples from over 1.5 million participants

While the census data is current for 2013, the other variables were produced/collected between 2013-2015. Not ideal, but I'm assuming their values are probably pretty stable from year to year. Another consideration is that the model might perform better if we could look at a more detailed observation level (e.g. counties or census tracts within states), but aside from the census data, the other characteristics are a bit harder to come by. C'est la vie. Anyways, let's take a quick look to see if any glaring characteristics stand out with the variables we have:

```{r var-facet}
levs <- c(
  "pop_norm_z", "income_norm_z", "rent_norm_z", "median_age", "bachelors_or_higher", 
  "black_alone", "white_alone", "hispanic_or_latino", "asian_alone",
  "binge_prev", "religiosity",
  "o", "c", "e", "a", "n"
)

labs <- c(

In each plot, every state is represented as a single dot, with the number of sightings increasing along the y-axis, and the variable of interest along the x-axis. I've added a trend line to each plot to help emphasize the relationships. Flat lines indicate that the relationship is equivocal or basically random. This seems to be largely the case for most of our characteristics, but, population size and cost of rent might be showing a hint of something. Of note, our binge-drinking prevalence variable doesn't appear to be related to the number of sightings at all. We can be a little more specific by letting the regression model simplify some of this for us.

Okay, last plot, I promise! The main benefit of a regression model is that it lets us understand how an individual variable in our data contributes to the outcome we're interested in. The plot above shows the average marginal effects from each variable in our model, allowing us to estimate how the count of sightings rises or falls as we increase the values of our predictors. What we're seeing is that income, rent, and population size appear to be fairly related with our outcome. If we imagine that we could pluck out an "average" state, and magically increase its population size by a standard-deviation above the country's average (holding the other variables constant), we'd expect to see around 72 additional sightings. Alternatively, if we did the same for the median rent, we'd expect to see 33 fewer sightings. Considering the average number of sightings was around 120, that's a fairly substantial impact.

All said and done, it's easier to say what's *not* related to the number of reported sightings than to explain *why* certain state characteristics appear correlated. At the very least, more reports are coming from areas where the population is probably larger, a little older, wealthier, and whose levels of openness and emotional stability are marginally higher. The best picture these results seem to paint is the western US. While minding necessary caveats about our observation level, and the fact that we're only using a single year of data, we might have enough to update our opinions about any obvious relationship between alcohol consumption and UFO sightings. Binge drinking and alcohol consumption in general aren't the same thing, but I would assume are positively related at the state level. Perhaps an index/score looking at binge drinking, state revenue from alcohol sales, and other variables together might clarify this relationship, but I'd argue that a state's level of binge drinking at least gives us a window into the region's permissiveness and attitudes about alcohol use. It could be the case that the population of people logging onto NUFORC's website to report sightings tend to drink more, but absent information about the reporters themselves, there's not enough to go off. By far, the biggest questions I have at this point center around what we don't know about the reporters. The fact that population size is positively related to sightings might be enough to say that reporters are mixed well enough into the population in general, but that isn't much of a starting point. Guess I'll just have to content myself with hopefully dodging the ecological fallacy.
